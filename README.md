Django movie rating homework

_This assignment was completed as part of my coursework at The Iron Yard._

##Django Movie Ratings

**Description**

We will be creating a large amount of data to "front load" our movies database using Schema and Data Migrations.

Create a Data Layer in Django with the MovieLens dataset.

**Learning Objectives**

After completing this assignment, you should be able to:

- Create a new Django application
- Translate real-world data to Django models
- Explain what a database is
- Explain what a model is
- Use the Django admin
- Structure the Django admin to reflect your data

**Normal Mode**

- Choose the 100k dataset from the MovieLens dataset options and read its README.
- Create a new Django application in your homework project to hold your models.
- Create Django models for users (call the model Rater so as not to confuse it with Django users), movies, and ratings. Make sure that your models can contain the data from your dataset.
- Create Django admin pages for your models.
- Using the data migration method we went over in class. Load in your fixture data from your datasets into Django models.

To complete this assignment, I used Python and Django.
